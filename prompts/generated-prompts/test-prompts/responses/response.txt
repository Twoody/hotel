With your current project set up, you should be able to test components using Vue Testing Library and Jest. However your current setup for testing is using Vitest.

Given that there is no JavaScript logic in your Vue component, there is very little to test outside of whether the component is rendered correctly. As such, the tests would look like this:

```js
import { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'
import About from '@/components/About.vue'

describe('About.vue', () => {
  it('renders about page', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(About)
    expect(wrapper.find('h1').text()).toBe('About Us')
    expect(wrapper.find('h2').text()).toBe('The Creators')
    
    const paragraphs = wrapper.findAll('p')
    expect(paragraphs.length).toBe(3)

    const listItems = wrapper.findAll('li')
    expect(listItems.length).toBe(3)

    expect(wrapper.find('.statistic').exists()).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

This test rendering of the component and checks the structure of the content.

Note: You would need to install Jest and the vue-test-utils library and configure it to use the Jest testing framework:
```
npm install vue-test-utils jest babel-jest vue-jest babel-preset-env -D
```
Then, create a jest.config.js file in the root directory with the following configuration.

```js
module.exports = {
  \"moduleFileExtensions\": [
    \"js\",
    \"json\",
    \"vue\"
  ],
  \"transform\": {
    \"^.+\\.js$\": \"<rootDir>/node_modules/babel-jest\",
    \".*\\.(vue)$\": \"<rootDir>/node_modules/vue-jest\"
  }
}
```
Remember this code is purely hypothetical, actual implementation may vary based on your use cases. 

And maybe, in this case, it would be appropriate to use Jest with 'vue-test-utils' as you don't have a vast application with multiple dependencies that require E2E testing, and Jest supports multiple test files operating concurrently and works out-of-the-box smoothly with most JavaScript projects, including Vue.",
