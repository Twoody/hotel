        "content": "Given that the source code comprises a Vue 3 component, tests would mainly involve rendering the component with its dependencies and then asserting various aspects related to the component. Before writing tests for the `BookingsTable` component, ensure that all required Vue libraries are setup for testing with Jest and are properly installed. They include `vue-test-utils`, `vue-jest` and `jest`.

Below are some tests that can be written for the provided component:

```js
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import store from \"@/store/store\"
import BookingsTable from '@/components/BookingsTable';

// You may need to add more mock data to cover all cases.
jest.mock('@/store/store', () => ({
  state: {
    user: {
      user: {
        uid: 'test'
      }
    }
  }
}))

describe('BookingsTable', () => {
  it('displays a loading indicator when fetching data', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(BookingsTable);
    wrapper.setData({ isLoading: true });

    expect(wrapper.find('Spinner').isVisible()).toBe(true);
  });

  it('shows a message when no bookings are found', async () => {
    const wrapper = mount(BookingsTable);
    await wrapper.setData({ isLoading: false, userBookings: [] });

    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('No bookings found.');
  });

  it('renders a table of bookings', async () => {
    const wrapper = mount(BookingsTable);
    await wrapper.setData({ 
      isLoading: false, 
      userBookings: [{  id: 'test', startDate: \"2023-11-23T10:20:30Z\", endDate: \"2023-11-24T10:20:30Z\", isPaid: true, status: \"Future\"}] 
    });

    expect(wrapper.find('table').isVisible()).toBe(true);
  });

  // Continue writing tests for other scenarios and functionalities such as sorting, deleting a booking etc.
});
```

Please replace the appropriate path with the actual path of `BookingsTable` component in your project.

Potential Issues with provided implementation:
1. Deleting a booking depends on external function (`deleteDoc`) without any error handling mechanism on component's end. It can lead to unhandled promises if something goes wrong in `deleteDoc`.
2. `fetchUserBookings()` does not seem to handle the situation when a user logs out and another user logs in within the lifetime of the component.
3. In the implementation, Vuex store's state is being accessed directly. It's recommended to access state through getters for consistent code. 
4. There is no error displaying mechanism for the user in the front end if an error occurs during API calls.
5. The method `deleteBooking` is public, and could be called without an id, which could cause unwanted errors.",
