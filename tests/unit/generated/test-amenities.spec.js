The code for testing the Amenities component might look like this:

```javascript
import { mount } from \"@vue/test-utils\";
import Amenities from \"@/components/entities/amenities/AmenitiesTable.vue\";

describe(\"Amenities.vue\", () => {
    let wrapper;

    beforeEach(() => {
        wrapper = mount(Amenities);
    });

    it(\"renders the correct markup\", () => {
        expect(wrapper.html()).toContain('<h1>Amenities</h1>');
        expect(wrapper.html()).toContain('<amenities-table-stub></amenities-table-stub>');
    });

    // Check if AmenitiesTable component is present
    it(\"has a component\", () => {
        expect(wrapper.findComponent({name: \"AmenitiesTable\"})).toBeTruthy();
    });
});
```

Note: This code is assuming that the import path \"@/components/entities/amenities/AmenitiesTable.vue\" is correct and the component is registered correctly in the components directory. If not, this path needs to be corrected in the provided source code.

We need more context to create more descriptive tests, for example, if the AmenitiesTable component triggers any events, or if these components have props to be passed.

Also, the Vue component does contain an empty created() lifecycle hook. This might not cause any runtime issues, but it is not needed and therefore should be removed.

Lastly, unit tests should not only pass but should also cover as much of the code as possible. Ensure to add more test cases that cover different parts of your component accordingly.",
