You will also test its interaction and behavior. For the purpose of these tests, we will use Vue Test Utils and Jest.

Also, note that aside from the unit tests, the file seems fine and does not seem to have any bugs. However, without the full context and a way to simulate all the interaction and behavior, it's not 100% possible to ensure if there might be any hidden issues.

```javascript
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import FacebookLogin from '@/components/FacebookLogin.vue'
import SocialLogin from '@/components/buttons/login/SocialLogin.vue'

// Mock the SocialLogin component
jest.mock('@/components/buttons/login/SocialLogin.vue', () => ({
  name: 'SocialLogin',
  render: () => {}
}))

describe('FacebookLogin.vue', () => {
  let wrapper

  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(FacebookLogin)
  })

  afterEach(() => {
    wrapper.unmount()
  })

  it('renders the SocialLogin component with correct provider', () => {
    const socialLogin = wrapper.findComponent(SocialLogin)
    expect(socialLogin.exists()).toBe(true)
    expect(socialLogin.props('provider')).toBe('facebook')
  })

  // Add more tests if needed to cover the logic in this component
})
```

With the current sample, there is no other component's logic to test however in cases where you have more complex components or methods invoked when interacting with the `SocialLogin` component, they should be tested thoroughly. 

Ensure that you have `@vue/test-utils` added to your `devDependencies`. The jest configuration file would include handling for `.vue` files and transpiler from ES6 to commonjs, if it's not set this way, the test script will fail.

Below is a sample Jest configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: '@vue/cli-plugin-unit-jest',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.vue$': 'vue-jest',
    '^.+\\js$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1',
  },
}
```

Let me know if you have any specific part which needs to be tested more. Unit tests generally should cover all methods and computed properties, however with that provided component that doesn't apply.",
