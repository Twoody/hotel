Here's a sample test file named `AmenitiesTable.spec.js`:

```javascript
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils';
import AmenitiesTable from '@/AmenitiesTable.vue';
import { AMENITIES } from 'src/constants/amenities.js';

describe('AmenitiesTable.vue', () => {

  let wrapper;
  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = shallowMount(AmenitiesTable);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    wrapper.unmount();
  });

  it('sorts the keys from AMENITIES constant', () => {
    const expectedKeys = Object.keys(AMENITIES).sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));
    expect(wrapper.vm.keys).toEqual(expectedKeys);
  });

  it('formats the title correctly', () => {
    expect(wrapper.vm.formatTitle(\"LIVING_ROOM\")).toBe(\"LIVING ROOM\");
  });

});
```

In the package.json, you would need to add the following in your scripts:

`\"test:unit\": \"vitest --config vitest.config.js\"`

To run the test, you would call `npm run test:unit`

On potential code issues:
1. The `components: {}` in the Vue component object is redundant as no components are being registered. This line can be removed without affecting the functionality of the code.
2. AMENITIES is assigned twice, once in the import and the other in the data object. It would be better to use the imported AMENITIES directly in the component. However, if there's a need to create a reactive copy of AMENITIES, a better approach might be using Vue's `reactive` API.
3. There are no prop validations for the input to the `AmenitiesSection` component. Depending on how the component is used, it may be useful to have appropriate type checks/validations for keys and amenities.
4. The CSS styles may not achieve the expected output. Without more context, it is unclear what the intended alignment or layout should be. In particular, \"align-content: center;\" may not work as intended without specific height settings.",
