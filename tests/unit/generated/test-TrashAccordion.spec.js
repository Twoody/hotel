Below, I am going to use Jest and the Vue Test Utils library to create some unit tests for the `Source File`.

```javascript
import { mount } from \"@vue/test-utils\";
import TrashQuestionAccordion from \"@/components/TrashQuestionAccordion.vue\";

describe(\"TrashQuestionAccordion\", () => {
  
  // Test to check the component mounts successfully
  test(\"mounts successfully\", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(TrashQuestionAccordion);
    expect(wrapper.exists()).toBe(true);
  });

  // Test to check the rendered content
  test(\"renders correct content\", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(TrashQuestionAccordion);
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain(\"Trash + Recycling + Pets\");
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain(\"Trash, recycling, and composte is picked up every Tuesday morning\");
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain(\"You can either contact Tanner or carry the trash up yourself\");
  });

  // Test to check correct class is applied
  test(\"correct class is applied\", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(TrashQuestionAccordion);
    expect(wrapper.classes()).toContain(\"trash-accordion-section\");
  });
  
  // Test to check for nested question accordion
  test(\"validates has-nested prop\", () => {
    const wrapper = mount(TrashQuestionAccordion, {
      props: {
        hasNested: true,
      }
    });
    
    expect(wrapper.vm.$props.hasNested).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Potential Issues with Updated Code
- There is a typo in the word \"composte\" which should be \"compost\".
- The `<QuestionAccordion>` component should have closing and opening tags before `<template #title>` and after the last `</template>` respectively.
- In source file, the component's name is given as `\"TashQuestionAccordion\"` which seems to be typo. It should probably be `\"TrashQuestionAccordion\"`.
- The usage of `<template #title>` and `<template #content>` assumes that these slots exist and are properly implemented in the `QuestionAccordion` component. We should ensure that this is the case.
- The wording in the content suggests that the trash can also be placed in the `dog poop trash`, which might not be correct or hygienic. 
- Inline styles are used to color span elements. This is not a good practice, CSS classes should preferably be used. 
- Accessibility can be improved by using more descriptive alternative text and other accessibility attributes where needed.
- The use of both scoped and global styles can lead to style conflicts and inconsistencies, something to watch out for when further developing or refactoring this component.",
