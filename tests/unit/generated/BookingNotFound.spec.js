Given that there's no interactivity (e.g., buttons, forms, clickable elements, etc.) in this component or any kind of computed properties or methods to work with; there's no need for doing unit testing on this specific component.

A unit test would be beneficial when you're working with components that contain:

- Methods (E.g., simulating click events on a button and asserting that the expected outcome/database mutation happens)
- Computed Properties (E.g., checking that computed properties return the correct data calculated from a methods or data properties)
- Props (E.g., passing a prop data and asserting if the component renders the passed data correctly)
- Data (E.g., ensuring that the initial state of the component is as expected)

For this reason, there's there's no unit testing possible on this task and no issues to report with regards to bugs or other issues.",
