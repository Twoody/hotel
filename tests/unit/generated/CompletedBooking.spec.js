```js
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import CompletedBooking from '@/components/CompletedBooking.vue'

describe('CompletedBooking.vue', () => {
  it('renders booking details when passed', () => {
    const booking = {
      id: 'test',
      guestID: 'guest1',
      startDate: '01-02-2022',
      endDate: '05-02-2022'
    }
    const wrapper = mount(CompletedBooking, {
      props: { booking }
    })
    expect(wrapper.text()).toMatch(`Booking ID: ${booking.id}`)
    expect(wrapper.text()).toMatch(`Guest ID: ${booking.guestID}`)
    expect(wrapper.text()).toMatch(`Start Date: ${booking.startDate}`)
    expect(wrapper.text()).toMatch(`End Date: ${booking.endDate}`)
  })
})
```

It's basically mounting the component with the `booking` props passed. It checks then by text matching if the booking info appears within the component.

This is a very basic example and in a real-world application, you'd likely want to add further test cases. For example, testing the user interaction logic and state management.

As for bugs or issues in the given code, without any further context or requirements, the `Source File` code seems fine. It simply displays a \"Booking Completed\" message along with some booking details, provided that `booking` is not null or undefined. However, it has no error handling or any validation that the properties of the `booking` object (id, guestID, startDate, endDate) exist, which could potentially lead to undefined values being displayed.",
