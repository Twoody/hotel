However, We cannot directly test the actual errors here because it depends largely on the application's context. Specific checks would need to be made based on external actions which isn't available in the given context.

So here is a basic test using Vue Test Utils:

```javascript
// UnauthorizedBooking.test.js 
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import UnauthorizedBooking from '@/components/UnauthorizedBooking.vue'

describe('UnauthorizedBooking.vue', () => {
  it('renders the component', () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(UnauthorizedBooking)
    expect(wrapper).toBeTruthy()
  })

  it('displays the correct title', () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(UnauthorizedBooking)
    expect(wrapper.find('h2').text()).toEqual('Access Denied')
  })

  it('displays the correct message', () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(UnauthorizedBooking)
    expect(wrapper.find('p').text()).toEqual('This booking does not belong to you, or you do not have permission to view it.')
  })
})
```

As for bugs or issues:

- There doesn't seem to be any obvious or critical bugs in the code.
- The application uses Vuejs 3, which is the latest major version of Vuejs.
- There's a progressive disclosure of information, not putting unnecessary burden on the users.
- User is given clear information about why they cant access the booking.
- The developer has used scoped CSS which is a good practice to modularize CSS.
- Semantic HTML has been used effectively which is good for accessibility and SEO.
- The Vue and other packages are up-to-date which is good for utilizing the latest features and security fixes.
  
One minor suggestion would be to use more descriptive class names, as \"unauthorized-booking-wrapper\" can be a bit long and vague.",
