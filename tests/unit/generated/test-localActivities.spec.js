However, assuming this file is being used in a part of an application, the test cases can be rendered to check whether it exports the data as intended and the correct structure and data is present.

```js
import { LOCAL_ACTIVITIES } from './source_file_path';

This code tests the basic functionality of the data exported in the provided file. The exported data object, `LOCAL_ACTIVITIES`, is checked to verify that it is defined.

Then, for each property in the `LOCAL_ACTIVITIES` object, we make certain assertions. We check that each object has a certain structure: `id`, `thumbnail`, `description`, `maps_id`, `tags`, and `title` properties should be defined. The `subtitle`, `start_at`, and `end_at` properties are optional and are only checked if they are defined.

These are not exhaustive tests but they form a good foundation upon which more specific unit tests can be built.

As for the rest of the code including the package.json and vitest.config.js - they seem to be configured correctly. The provided configuration and dependencies seem to be fairly standard for a Vue project that uses Vitest for testing. However, without the rest of the codebase, it's hard to comment on possible issues or bugs. However, it is recommended to keep all dependencies, including `vite`, `vue`, `eslint`, etc., up-to-date to avoid potential issues related to old versions.",
