        "content": "This source file contains two constant objects MAPS and MAP_FILTERS which are exported from the module. Unfortunately, these exported objects are plain JavaScript objects with no logic or functionality, which means that they cannot be tested in a traditional sense.

However, you can verify their structure, but even that might be overkill in practice since those are clearly static, hardly changing values. But for completeness, here are basic \"tests\" which just checks that the MAPS and MAP_FILTERS objects have the expected shape.

JUnit Testing:

```javascript
import { MAPS, MAP_FILTERS } from './maps.js';

test('MAPS has all properties', () => {
    const mapKeys = Object.keys(MAPS);
    const expectedKeys = [
        'BURNSIDE',
        'CANBY',
        'COLUMBIA_RIVER_GORGE',
        'EUGENE',
        'LAKE_OSWEGO',
        'LAVENDER_FARMS',
        'MADDOX',
        'MARKETS',
        'MSY',
        'MT_HOOD',
        'OREGON_CITY',
        'OREGON_COAST',
        'SAUVY_ISLAND',
        'STUB_STEWART',
        'TRYON',
        'WILAMETE_RIVER',
        'WILDNERNESS',
    ];
    expect(mapKeys.sort()).toEqual(expectedKeys.sort());
});

test('MAP_FILTERS has all properties', () => {
    const filterKeys = Object.values(MAP_FILTERS);
    const expectedValues = [
        \"Dog Friendly\",
        \"Food\",
        \"Groceries\",
        \"Child Friendly\",
        \"Running\",
        \"Hiking\",
        \"Exercise\",
        \"Attractions\",
        \"Drinks\",
        \"Walking\",
        \"Shopping\",
        \"Music\",
    ];
    expect(filterKeys.sort()).toEqual(expectedValues.sort());
});
```

Please note that these tests offer very little value as any change in these objects has to be reflected in the tests too, defeating the original purpose of finding bugs or issues with the code. If these constants are created by logic or are otherwise volatile, unit tests would be more valuable. For truly constant values, the validity is often assumed or, if necessary, validated by application-level integration tests. It's important to analyze what could potentially break in the tested module and focus on unit tests that make sure these breakages are caught.

I didn't find any bugs within the source file, however, I do want to also state the fact that these are pure static data without any logic, so the possibility of bugs is very low. If these static values are connected with some implementation, then we have to test that implementation, but not the static data itself.",
