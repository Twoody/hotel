Here is an example of a test:

```jsx
import { mount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import CheckInAndOutQuestionAccordion from '@/path/to/CheckInAndOutQuestionAccordion.vue'

describe('CheckInAndOutQuestionAccordion.vue', () => {
  let wrapper

  beforeEach(() => {
    wrapper = mount(CheckInAndOutQuestionAccordion)
  })

  it('renders the title properly ', () => {
    expect(wrapper.find('.accordion-section').text()).toContain('Check In / Check Out')
  })

  it('renders the check in instructions ', () => {
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Check in by getting the details via airbnb for now.')
  })
  
  it('renders the check out instructions', () => {
    expect(wrapper.text()).toContain('Check out by just sending us a text, letting us know when you are gone.')
  })
})
```

This test file mounts the CheckInAndOutQuestionAccordion vue component using the vue-test-utils, and checks if it renders specific texts related to each check-in and check-out instructions.

To run the tests, you can add another script to package.json: \"test:unit\": \"jest\"

This will allow you to run \"npm run test:unit\" or \"yarn test:unit\".

The code provided does not seem to have bugs. However, further examination may be needed to effectively debug all aspects of functionality, performance, security, and other essential aspects. 

Please note that the path to the file CheckInAndOutQuestionAccordion.vue in the test might need to change based on your file structure. Also, the accuracy of these tests might vary based on the implementation of QuestionAccordion, which is a nested component here.
