A simple snapshot test using [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) and Jest could look something like this:

```JavaScript
import { shallowMount } from '@vue/test-utils'
import ParkingQuestionAccordion from '@/components/ParkingQuestionAccordion.vue' //Path to your component

describe('ParkingQuestionAccordion', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    const wrapper = shallowMount(ParkingQuestionAccordion)
    expect(wrapper.element).toMatchSnapshot()
  })
})
```
This test will render the ParkingQuestionAccordion component, take a snapshot, and compare it to a reference snapshot that's stored alongside the test. The test will fail if the two snapshots don't match. 

For any further testing, we need the interaction points (e.g methods, events, etc.) inside the component. 

Regarding bugs or issues, it's hard to say without the context of the full application, but at first glance, the code looks fine. Just ensure that the `QuestionAccordion` component that's being used in the parent component is correctly defined and imported.

You should also ensure that the `QuestionAccordion` component correctly handles the `class` prop and `has-nested` attribute, and knows how to render default slots, named slots (`title` and `content`), and how they are used in the child component.
